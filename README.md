# Multiple-Regression

Multiple regression is a statistical technique that aims to predict a variable of interest from several other variables. The variable that's predicted is known as the criterion. The variables that predict the criterion are known as predictors.

The multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions:

 #There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables.
 #The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other.
 #yi observations are selected independently and randomly from the population.
 #Residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance Ïƒ.
